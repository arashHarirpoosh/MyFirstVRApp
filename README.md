# MyUE5.1PlayGround
This repository contains my projects for the Immersive Technologies course, implemented using Unreal Engine 5.1.

## Table of Contents
Project 1: [MyFirstUEApp]
Project 2: [SolarSystemSimulation]
Project 3: [MyFirstVRApp]
### Project 1: [MyFirstUEApp]
#### Implemented Features:
	1. Adding different shapes to the map.
	2. The W/S keys on the keyboard can be used to move forward or backward.
	3. The A/D keys on the keyboard can be used to move left or right.
	4. The mouse movement is used to rotate the character.
	5. The right joystick of the gamepad is used to perform the character's movement (Although the previous function could be used, another function was implemented that works by using 2D vectors of X and Y changes of the joystick).
	6. The left joystick of the gamepad is used to perform the character's Rotation (Although the previous function could be used, another function was implemented that works by using 2D vectors of X and Y changes of the joystick).
	7. The character will be teleported 100 units forward by clicking L1 (LT).
	8. The character will be teleported 100 units to the right by clicking R1 (RT).
	9. The character will be teleported 100 units in the sky by clicking L2 (LB).

### Project 2: [SolarSystemSimulation]
#### Implemented Features:
	1. Using the Spring Arm component to perform the planet's orbital rotation around the sun or Earth.
	2. Cameras can be switched by pressing the C button.
 
### Project 3: [MyFirstVRApp]
#### Implemented features:
	1. The joystick of the left controller is used to perform the character's Rotation
	2. The joystick of the right controller is used to perform the character's Movement
	3. Pressing Y on the left controller while grabbing an object with the right controller will result in releasing the object 100 unit further on the x and y axis
	4. Pressing B on the right controller while grabbing an object with the left controller will result in releasing the object 100 unit further on the x and y axis
	5. Moving two objects while grabbing each of them with one controller will result in forming a single object that is created by attaching two components to each other
